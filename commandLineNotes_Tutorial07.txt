The following steps describe the processes necessary to align sequences, build a hmm profile, and search a proteome (in this example) using the built hmm profile.

---- STEP 1 ----

In order to run muscle, the binary file needs to be made executable with the following command:
> chmod +x muscleVERSION_OS
For example:
> chmod +x muscle3.8.31_i86linux64 

After the binary file for muscle has been made executable, it is possbile to use muscle to perform alignment of input sequences as follows:
> ./muscleVERSION_OS -in inputSequencefile -out alignmentOutput.afa
For example:
> ./muscle3.8.31_i86linux64 -in ICB2019_Tutorial07/sigma70.refs -out sigma70Seqs.afa

It should be noted that the -out flag expects the name for the intended output from running muscle on the input sequences indicated by the -in flag. This means the file name specified by -out should not already exsist, it will be created by muscle.

---- STEP 2 ----

Now that there are algined files produced by muscle, it is possible to use the hmmbuild function from hmmer to create a profile hmm build:
> hmmbuild -o buildSummary.txt buildOutput.hmm alignmentOutput.afa
For example:
> hmmbuild -o sigma70_hmmSummary.txt sigma70.hmm sigma70Seqs.afa

Note that the aligned sequences file (.afa) that is being input to hmmbuild is the alignment file produced by muscle in the previous step.

---- STEP 3 ----

Finally, an input proteome may be searched using the profile generated by the previous hmmbuild command:
> hmmsearch buildOutput.hmm proteomeInput.fasta > searchOutput.out
For example:
> hmmsearch sigma70.hmm ICB2019_Tutorial07/Roseobacter.fasta > sigma70.out

Again, note that the input hmm build profile to the hmmsearch function is the file produced by hmmbuild in the previous step.
