The following steps describe the processes necessary to align sequences, build a hmm profile, and search a proteome (in this example) using the built hmm profile.

---- STEP 1 ----

In order to run muscle, the binary file needs to be made executable with the following command:
> chmod +x muscleVERSION_OS
For example:
> chmod +x muscle3.8.31_i86linux64 

After the binary file for muscle has been made executable, it is possbile to use muscle to perform alignment of input sequences as follows:
> ./muscleVERSION_OS -in inputSequencefile -out alignmentOutput.afa
For example:
> ./muscle3.8.31_i86linux64 -in ICB2019_Tutorial07/sigma70.refs -out sigma70Seqs.afa

It should be noted that the -out flag expects the name for the intended output from running muscle on the input sequences indicated by the -in flag. This means the file name specified by -out should not already exsist, it will be created by muscle.

---- STEP 2 ----

Now that there are algined files produced by muscle, it is possible to use the hmmbuild function from hmmer to create a profile hmm build:
> hmmbuild -o buildSummary.txt buildOutput.hmm alignmentOutput.afa
For example:
> hmmbuild -o sigma70_hmmSummary.txt sigma70.hmm sigma70Seqs.afa

Note that the aligned sequences file (.afa) that is being input to hmmbuild is the alignment file produced by muscle in the previous step.

---- STEP 3 ----

Finally, an input proteome may be searched using the profile generated by the previous hmmbuild command:
> hmmsearch buildOutput.hmm proteomeInput.fasta > searchOutput.out
For example:
> hmmsearch sigma70.hmm ICB2019_Tutorial07/Roseobacter.fasta > sigma70.out

Again, note that the input hmm build profile to the hmmsearch function is the file produced by hmmbuild in the previous step.

---- HMMER INSTALLATION NOTE ----

If the hmmbuild or hmmsearch commands are unable to be found by the terminal (command line), it may be necessary to direct the terminal to where the binary files for hmmer are installed with the following command:
> PATH=$PATH:~/Private/bin

Please note that the binary files for hmmer should be installed in the ~/Private/bin directory during configuration (./configure --prefix ~/Private/bin). Additionally, the ~/Private/bin folder should not already exsist, since it will be created by hmmer during installation. If the folder already exsist, the binary files for hmmer will by installed in ~/Private/bin/bin. Thus, the direction for the build files would need to be changed as follows:
> PATH=$PATH:~/Private/bin/bin

The hmmbuild and hmmsearch functions should be able to be called (used) from within any directory, after the path variable (PATH) has been set for the terminal session.
